# Contributing to TinyProgress

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TinyProgress! This project aims to be a lightweight and simple module for displaying progress bars in Python. To maintain its simplicity, we follow some strict contribution rules.

## Project Principles

1. **Minimalism**: Keep the code as simple and small as possible.
2. **No external dependencies**: Do not add new dependencies that are not standard in Python.
3. **Ease of use**: The API should be intuitive and easy to understand.
4. **Compatibility**: The code should be compatible with recent Python versions without breaking backward compatibility if possible.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Report an Issue
If you find a bug or have a suggestion, open an [Issue](https://github.com/croketillo/tinyprogress/issues) describing the problem or improvement.

### 2. Make an Improvement or Fix
If you want to contribute code, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it to your local machine.
2. **Create a new branch** with a descriptive name:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix-bug-x
   ```
3. **Make changes ensuring they align with the project principles.**
4. **Ensure your code does not introduce external dependencies.**
5. **Verify that the code follows PEP 8 style** (except where simplicity makes it unnecessary).
6. **Ensure changes do not significantly increase the module size.**
7. **Run tests before submitting your contribution.**
8. **Ensure your code passes the automated tests in GitHub Actions.** Every Pull Request will be validated with these tests, and only changes that pass them will be accepted.

### 3. Submit a Pull Request
When you're ready, open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/croketillo/tinyprogress/pulls) ensuring that you:

- Clearly explain the purpose of the change.
- Indicate if it resolves an existing issue.
- Attach usage examples if relevant.
- Confirm that the code passes automated tests.

## Review and Merging
Maintainers will review contributions considering the project's principles. If necessary, they will request adjustments before merging.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your code will be published under the same license as the project.
